# CSGO configuration

`autoexec.cfg` should be placed under `steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`
directory. It is a native configuration file generated by csgo, but users may edit it to set custom
key bindings. Note that this configuration will apply to all accounts on the computer. If you wish to
apply this configuration only to a specific user, then copy the content and paste to your local config
file, i.e., `userdata\<user_id>\730\local\cfg\config.cfg`.
